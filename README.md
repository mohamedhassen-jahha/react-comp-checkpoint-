# Objective

In this checkpoint, we are going to use what we have learned so far to play around with some React components and JSX

## Instructions

- Create a project using create-react-app.
- Create App.js file in src folder and use it as a root component for your React app.
- Create a profile folder (path: src/Component/Profile).
- Inside your profile folder, create: (ProfilePhoto.js / FullName.js / Address.js ).
- ProfilePhoto.js: a functional component that returns a photo of your profile.
- FullName.js: a functional component that returns your full name.
- Address.js: a functional component that returns your address.
- Import profile components into App.js and use them.
- Feel free to style your app as you wish.
